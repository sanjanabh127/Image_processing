**Image Processing**

This project demonstrates multiple image processing techniques using OpenCV and NumPy. It includes operations such as converting RGB images to black & white, blurring, thresholding, pixelization, image scaling, background removal, sharpening, and even printing image columns for analysis.

**Tech Stack**

Python

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Matplotlib (for visualization)

**Features Implemented**

1.RGB â†’ Grayscale Conversion:

Converts a colored (RGB) image into a black & white (grayscale) version.

2.Image Blurring:

Smoothens the image using Gaussian/median blur techniques.

3.Thresholding:

Applies binary thresholding to highlight regions of interest.

4.Pixelization:

Reduces resolution intentionally to give a pixel-art effect.

5.Printing Columns:

Extracts and prints pixel column data for analysis/debugging.

6.Image Scaling:

Resize images (zoom in/out) while preserving quality using interpolation methods.

7.Background Removal:

Removes the background by applying masking and segmentation techniques.

8.Image Sharpening:

Enhances edges and fine details using convolution kernels.
